I’m a beginner in the development field, driven by a passion for shapes, colors, and design. I chose the path of Front-end development, focusing on learning and integrating technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Typescript, while also exploring UX/UI. I’m always looking for challenges that allow me to improve my skills and push myself to the next level. My goal is to become a Full Stack developer, expanding my abilities and contributing to innovative projects.
