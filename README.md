While also exploring <strong>UX</strong>/<strong>UI</strong> and looking foward to start the study of <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Tailwind</strong>.<br><br>I’m always looking for challenges that allow me to improve my skills and push myself to the next level. My goal is to become a Full Stack developer, expanding my abilities and contributing to innovative projects.
